Hey there,

I'm proud to announce that my first peer-reviewed paper "*One for all and all for one: Linear regression from the mass of individual bones to assess human skeletal mass completeness*" is out on the renewed <a href = "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.22979/abstract" target = "_blank">*American Journal of Forensic Anthropology*.</a>

Not a bad magazine for the first one, huh?

This was a collaborative work lead by <a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt/member/david_goncalves/" target = "_blank">David Gon√ßalves</a> that counted with the help of many <a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt/team/">team members</a> from the <a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt/" target = "_blank">Laboraty of Forensic Anthropology</a>. I was deeply involved in this project from the beginning, and my main contributions were with the statistical analysis and predictive modelling. Plus, designing and programming a simple webapp, that was branded as <a href = "http://apps.osteomics.com/MassReg" target = "_blank">MassReg</a>. It allows users to explore our data and apply our models to their own samples.

Neat no? 

We also gave recently a conferece talk titled <a href = "http://www.jornadasmediterraneasbadajoz.com/premios-comunicaciones-y-poster/comunicaciones-aceptadas" target = "_blank">"MassReg: An application to predict the skeleton mass of adult individuals in incomplete or poorly preserved assemblages of human remains</a> where we explored and explained the potential of the app for an audience of researchers that gathered in Badajoz, Spain.

By the way, 2 days from now on, there will be 2 posters presentations in the 85th AAPA that I'd like to bring your attention to:

+ Scott et al. 2016. <a href = "http://meeting.physanth.org/program/2016/session11/scott-2016-rasudas-a-new-method-for-estimating-ancestry-from-tooth-crown-and-root-morphology.html" target = "_blank">rASUDAS: A New Method for Estimating Ancestry from Tooth Crown and Root Morphology</a>
+ Marcia et al. 2016. <a href = "http://meeting.physanth.org/program/2016/session11/santos-2016-sex-diagnosis-of-the-human-dentition-after-heat-exposure-the-potential-of-cementum-enamel-junction-and-root-dimensions.html" target = "_blank">Sex diagnosis of the human dentition after heat exposure: the potential of cementum-enamel junction and root dimensions</a>

That's all!

Keep on
