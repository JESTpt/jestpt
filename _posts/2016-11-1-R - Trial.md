R is a language designed to aid its user in all fields of data science, ranging from life sciences to all sorts of statistical treatment and data science in its core. JEST is offering you the unique opportunity to learn R from people doing research with it in two modules.

The first, on the 28th and the 29th of November, grants you the opportunity to learn the first steps of R. It is a module designed for both the absolute beginner and the practitioner that needs to refresh basic concepts or relearn forgotten ones.
