Today, I created a Zotero and Mendeley (.CSL 1.0.1) compatible reference style for the scientific magazines: *Antropologia Portuguesa* and *Cadernos do GEEvH*. My reason for doing this, is mainly because even though there was already an online version of this reference-style, it was only available for the paid-software EndNote. Since Zotero is free, it is definitely a more student-friendly option that I recommend to everyone. In the same spirit, I am sharing this for free to whoever might want or need it.

This .csl file uses the style described in <a href = "http://impactum-journals.uc.pt/index.php/antropologiaportuguesa/about/submissions#authorGuidelines" taget = "_blank"><i>Antropologia Portuguesa</i> Guidelines</a>. You can download it directly from <a href = "https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl/raw/master/antropologia-portuguesa.csl" target = "_blank">here</a> or by visiting the <a href = "https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl" target = "_blank">GitHub repo</a>, an open collaborative coding platform where you can suggest modifications to the file.

### Instructions:

1. Install Zotero if you haven't done so.
2. Download the `antropologia-portuguesa.csl` from <a href="https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl">GitHub</a>.
3. Double click on the file.
4. In Zotero's settings, change your current style to "Antropologia Portuguesa".
5. You are ready to go!


Enjoy it.
