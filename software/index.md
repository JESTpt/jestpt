## hefneR

<a href = "http://apps.osteomics.com/hefneR" target = "_blank">Click here to try hefneR!</a>

First app I have ever done using the R and Shiny environment. An homage to Hefner's life work in forensic anthropology and ancestry.

{% include gallery images=images caption="hefneR is a fully functional app for ancestry estimation based of morphoscopic traits of the human skull." cols=3 %}

## MassReg

<a href = "http://apps.osteomics.com/MassReg" target = "_blank">Click here to try MassReg!</a>

Last work based on a paper that will soon be submited. Objective is to predict the **total skeletal mass** (y variable) based on the mass of single bones (x variable), through simple linear regression models.

## cranExplr

<a href = "http://apps.osteomics.com/cranExplr/" target = "_blank">Click here to try cranExplr!</a>

Project done in less than a day for official submission in the online course <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod" target = "_blank">Developing Data Products</a> from the Johns Hopkins University. I also had to submit an online presentation fully programmed in R, that you can can check <a href = "http://rpubs.com/Del/cranExplrDeck" target = "_blank">here</a>.

{% capture images %}
  /images/cranP1.png
  /images/cranP2.png
  /images/cranP3.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="cranExplr is supposed to be just a visual exploration tool. However, it can also be used for case-by-case estimation if you have complete crania at hand." cols=3 %}

## rASUDAS

<a href = "https://dsnavega.shinyapps.io/r-asudas-app/" target = "_blank">Click here to try rASUDAS!</a>

A predictive software based on ASUDAS and developed in R stemming from a collaborative effort with <a href = "https://github.com/dsnavega"  target = "_blank">David Navega</a> and Professor <a href = "http://www.unr.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/g-richard-scott" target = "_blank">G. Richard Scott</a> that was born during the <a href = "http://www.uc.pt/fctuc/dcv/eventos/2015/IIbam" target = "_blank">II Bioanthropological Meeting</a> (Coimbra, Portugal). Together, we will revolutionize the field of dental morphology while creating a very useful new tool for ancestry estimation. The current version is a very early prototype, but already fully functional. Soon, we will update it with a far larger database and optimized algorithm, and provide also an offline executable version.
