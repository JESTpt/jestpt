For as long as memory allows me to dive in I've had an inordinate fondness for drawing and playing aroud with illustration software.

## Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology

<figure>
  <img src="http://jcoelho.com/images/lafLogo1.png" alt="Laboratório de Antropologia Forense">
  <figcaption>The idea was to recreate the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man" target = "_blank">Vitruvian Man</a> concept, a Da Vinci's famous drawing. But instead, using a skeleton to represent the main object of study for forensic anthropologists. This is a logo I've designed for a portuguese lab of forensic anthropology hosted at the University of Coimbra, Portugal.</figcaption>

## osteomics.com

My most personal project, <a href = "http://osteomics.com" target = "_blank">osteomics</a> is a business focused in solving problems related to osteology. The logo was first hand-draw, then vectorized with a computer.

  <figcaption>The HOT Project has brought together a group of researchers insterested in burnt bones and teeth. This logo was developed based on an earlier similar concept originally thought by David Gonçalves. While I tend to prefer version A, the one ending up being chosen was C.</figcaption>

## Scientific Posters

One of the stuff I enjoy the most is to design scientifc posters that are clean, minimalist and easily convey useful info to the public in conferences.

I also made a huge tileset with Pokémon graphics compatible with RPG Maker XP, you can download <a href = "http://jcoelho.com/images/pixelart/tileset.png" target = "_blank">it here</a>, it will take a will to load.
