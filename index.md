		<p>Junior Enterprise for Science and Technology (JEST) – has as its purpose the understanding of interdisciplinary value and the commitment to ever evolving projects and ideas, aiming for the development of such in the fields of science and technology.</p>
		<p>Cradled in the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra, JEST embraces the challenge of diverse data analysis and comprehension, designed and nurtured both for its members, who can get a useful complement to their academic formation as well as constantly progressing and challenging projects, professors, companies and research groups that are essential for science’s development and professional growth. Thus, under the flag of data science advancement - pedagogic, personal, professional and teambuilding wise - JEST sets both its starting line and its goals on its members, as well as any projects and entities that further down the timeline get involved with it.</p>

At an individual level, JEST members have ambitious goals. However, this is the fuel that drives the collective purpose as it was previously described. With an environment of equality and personal features optimization, JEST sets its tone as an original junior enterprise aiming at putting science through a data perspective as well as adding a science perspective to data.</p>
